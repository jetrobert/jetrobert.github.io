In MongoDB, records are documents which behave a lot like JSON objects in JavaScript. Values in documents can be looked up by their field’s key. Documents can have some fields/keys and not others, which makes Mongo extremely flexible. This is much different than SQL databases like MySQL, where fields correspond to columns in a table and individual records correspond to rows. Install and Run MongoDB with Homebrew Make sure Homebrew already installed on Mac (Homebrew is a package manager for the Mac – it makes installing most open source software). Open the Mac terminal application and type brew update, then type brew install mongodb After MongoDB is downloaded, create a directory to store MongoDB data files, type mkdir -p /data/db Make sure the directory has the right permissions: 12&gt; sudo chown -R `id -un` /data/db&gt; # Enter your psd Run the Mongo daemon by typing mongod in your terminal window.

Taking row and column fractions less than 1 helps in making robust models, less prone to overfitting. 2) Build Multiple Classifiers Classifiers are built on each data set. Generally the same classifier is modeled on each dataset and predictions are made. 3) Combine Classifiers The predictions of all the classifiers are combined using a mean, median or mode value depending on the problem at hand. The combined values are generally more robust than a single model. Note that, here the number of models built is not a hyper-parameters. Higher number of models are always better or may give similar performance than lower numbers.

Ensemble methods involve group of predictive models to achieve a better accuracy and model stability. Ensemble methods are known to impart supreme boost to tree based models.

Bias means, ‘how much on an average are the predicted values different from the actual value.’ Variance means, ‘how different will the predictions of the model be at the same point if different samples are taken from the same population’. You build a small tree and you will get a model with low variance and high bias. How do you manage to balance the trade off between bias and variance ? Normally, as you increase the complexity of your model, you will see a reduction in prediction error due to lower bias in the model. As you continue to make your model more complex, you end up over-fitting your model and your model will start suffering from high variance. A champion model should maintain a balance between these two types of errors. This is known as the trade-off management of bias-variance errors.

If there is no limit set of a decision tree, it will give you 100% accuracy on training set because in the worse case it will end up making 1 leaf for each observation. Thus, preventing overfitting is pivotal while modeling a decision tree and it can be done in 2 ways: 1) Setting constraints on tree size.2) Tree pruning. Let’s discuss both of these briefly. Setting Constraints on Tree SizeThis can be done by using various parameters which are used to define a tree. First, let‘s look at the general structure of a decision tree. The parameters used for defining a tree are further explained below. The parameters described below are irrespective of tool. It is important to understand the role of parameters used in tree modeling. These parameters are available in R &amp; Python. Minimum samples for a node split 1) Defines the minimum number of samples (or observations) which are required in a node to be considered for splitting.2) Used to control over-fitting. Higher values prevent a model from learning relations which might be highly specific to the particular sample selected for a tree.3) Too high values can lead to under-fitting hence, it should be tuned using CV. Minimum samples for a terminal node (leaf) 1) Defines the minimum samples (or observations) required in a terminal node or leaf.2) Used to control over-fitting similar to min_samples_split.3) Generally lower values should be chosen for imbalanced class problems because the regions in which the minority class will be in majority will be very small. Maximum depth of tree (vertical depth) 1) The maximum depth of a tree.2) Used to control over-fitting as higher depth will allow model to learn relations very specific to a particular sample.3) Should be tuned using CV. Maximum number of terminal nodes 1) The maximum number of terminal nodes or leaves in a tree.2) Can be defined in place of max_depth. Since binary trees are created, a depth of ‘n’ would produce a maximum of 2^n leaves. Maximum features to consider for split 1) The number of features to consider while searching for a best split. These will be randomly selected.2) As a thumb-rule, square root of the total number of features works great but we should check up to 30-40% of the total number of features.3) Higher values can lead to over-fitting but depends on case to case. Tree PruningAs discussed earlier, the technique of setting constraint is a greedy-approach. In other words, it will check for the best split instantaneously and move forward until one of the specified stopping condition is reached. Let’s consider the following case when you’re driving. There are 2 lanes: 1) A lane with cars moving at 80km/h.2) A lane with trucks moving at 30km/h. At this instant, you are the yellow car and you have 2 choices: 1) Take a left and overtake the other 2 cars quickly.2) Keep moving in the present lane. Let’s analyze these choice. In the former choice, you’ll immediately overtake the car ahead and reach behind the truck and start moving at 30 km/h, looking for an opportunity to move back right. All cars originally behind you move ahead in the meanwhile. This would be the optimum choice if your objective is to maximize the distance covered in next say 10 seconds. In the later choice, you sale through at same speed, cross trucks and then overtake maybe depending on situation ahead. Greedy you! This is exactly the difference between normal decision tree &amp; pruning. A decision tree with constraints won’t see the truck ahead and adopt a greedy approach by taking a left. On the other hand if we use pruning, we in effect look at a few steps ahead and make a choice. How to prune? So we know pruning is better. But how to implement it in decision tree? The idea is simple. 1) We first make the decision tree to a large depth.2) Then we start at the bottom and start removing leaves which are giving us negative returns when compared from the top.3) Suppose a split is giving us a gain of say -10 (loss of 10) and then the next split on that gives us a gain of 20. A simple decision tree will stop at step 1 but in pruning, we will see that the overall gain is +10 and keep both leaves. Note Note that sklearn’s decision tree classifier does not currently support pruning. Advanced packages like xgboost have adopted tree pruning in their implementation. But the library rpart in R, provides a function to prune.

Most implementations produce a stable sort, which means that the implementation preserves the input order of equal elements in the sorted output. Mergesort is a divide and conquer algorithm that was invented by John von Neumann in 1945. DefinitionConceptually, a merge sort works as follows: 1) Divide the unsorted list into n sublists, each containing 1 element (a list of 1 element is considered sorted). 2) Repeatedly merge sublists to produce new sorted sublists until there is only 1 sublist remaining.

This means that decision trees are typically drawn upside down such that leaves are the bottom &amp; roots are the tops (shown below). Both the trees work almost similar to each other, let’s look at the primary differences &amp; similarity between classification and regression trees: 1) Regression trees are used when dependent variable is continuous. Classification trees are used when dependent variable is categorical. 2) In case of regression tree, the value obtained by terminal nodes in the training data is the mean response of observation falling in that region. Thus, if an unseen data observation falls in that region, we’ll make its prediction with mean value. 3) In case of classification tree, the value (class) obtained by terminal node in the training data is the mode of observations falling in that region. Thus, if an unseen data observation falls in that region, we’ll make its prediction with mode value. 4) Both the trees divide the predictor space (independent variables) into distinct and non-overlapping regions. For the sake of simplicity, you can think of these regions as high dimensional boxes or boxes. 5) Both the trees follow a top-down greedy approach known as recursive binary splitting. We call it as ‘top-down’ because it begins from the top of tree when all the observations are available in a single region and successively splits the predictor space into two new branches down the tree. It is known as ‘greedy’ because, the algorithm cares (looks for best variable available) about only the current split, and not about future splits which will lead to a better tree. 6) This splitting process is continued until a user defined stopping criteria is reached. For example: we can tell the algorithm to stop once the number of observations per node becomes less than 50. 7) In both the cases, the splitting process results in fully grown trees until the stopping criteria is reached. But, the fully grown tree is likely to overfit data, leading to poor accuracy on unseen data. This bring ‘pruning’. Pruning is one of the technique used tackle overfitting.","categories":[{"name":"ML","slug":"ML","permalink":"https://jetrobert.github.io/categories/ML/"}],"tags":[{"name":"ML","slug":"ML","permalink":"https://jetrobert.github.io/tags/ML/"},{"name":"Regression","slug":"Regression","permalink":"https://jetrobert.github.io/tags/Regression/"},{"name":"Classification","slug":"Classification","permalink":"https://jetrobert.github.io/tags/Classification/"}],"author":"Stephen Cheng"},{"title":"Levenshtein Distance","slug":"LevenshteinDistance","date":"2018-04-18T10:09:03.000Z","updated":"2019-12-25T10:10:10.803Z","comments":true,"path":"2018/04/18/LevenshteinDistance/","link":"","permalink":"https://jetrobert.github.io/2018/04/18/LevenshteinDistance/","excerpt":"","text":"&nbsp; Stephen Cheng IntroLevenshtein distance is a string metric for measuring the difference between two sequences.

It works for both categorical and continuous input and output variables. In this technique, the population or sample are split into two or more homogeneous sets (or sub-populations) based on most significant splitter differentiator in input variables. ExampleSay we have a sample of 30 students with three variables: Gender (Boy/Girl), Class(IX/X) and Height (5 to 6 ft). 15 out of these 30 play cricket in leisure time. Now, we want to create a model to predict who will play cricket during leisure period? In this problem, we need to segregate students who play cricket in their leisure time based on highly significant input variable among all three. This is where decision tree helps, it will segregate the students based on all values of three variables and identify the variable, which creates the best homogeneous sets of students (which are heterogeneous to each other). In the snapshot below, you can see that variable Gender is able to identify best homogeneous sets compared to the other two variables. As mentioned above, decision tree identifies the most significant variable and its value that gives best homogeneous sets of population. Now the question which arises is, how does it identify the variable and the split? To do this, decision tree uses various algorithms, which we will shall discuss in the following section. Types of Decision TreesTypes of decision tree are based on the type of target variable we have. It can be of two types: 1) Categorical Variable Decision Tree This type of Decision Tree which has categorical target variable then it called as categorical variable decision tree. E.g., in above scenario of student problem, where the target variable was “Student will play cricket or not” i.e. YES or NO. 2) Continuous Variable Decision Tree This type of Decision Tree has continuous target variable then it is called as Continuous Variable Decision Tree. ExampleLet’s say we have a problem to predict whether a customer will pay his renewal premium with an insurance company (yes/no). Here we know that income of a customer is a significant variable but insurance company does not have income details for all customers. Now, as we know this is an important variable, then we can build a decision tree to predict customer income based on occupation, age and various other variables. In this case, we are predicting values for continuous variable. Important TerminologyLet’s look at the basic terminology used with Decision trees: 1) Root Node It represents entire population or sample and this further gets divided into two or more homogeneous sets. 2) Splitting It is a process of dividing a node into two or more sub-nodes. 3) Decision Node When a sub-node splits into further sub-nodes, then it is called decision node. 4) Leaf/Terminal Node Nodes do not split is called Leaf or Terminal node. 5) PruningWhen we remove sub-nodes of a decision node, this process is called pruning. You can say opposite process of splitting. 6) Branch/Sub-Tree A sub section of entire tree is called branch or sub-tree. 7) Parent and Child Node A node, which is divided into sub-nodes is called parent node of sub-nodes where as sub-nodes are the child of parent node. These above are the terms commonly used for decision trees. As we know that every algorithm has advantages and disadvantages, below are the important factors which one should know. Advantages1) Easy to Understand Decision tree output is very easy to understand even for people from non-analytical background. It does not require any statistical knowledge to read and interpret them. Its graphical representation is very intuitive and users can easily relate their hypothesis. 2) Useful in Data Exploration Decision tree is one of the fastest way to identify most significant variables and relation between two or more variables. With the help of decision trees, we can create new variables/features that has better power to predict target variable. For example, we are working on a problem where we have information available in hundreds of variables, there decision tree will help to identify most significant variable. 3) Less Data Cleaning Required It requires less data cleaning compared to some other modeling techniques. It is not influenced by outliers and missing values to a fair degree. 4) Data Type Is Not a Constraint It can handle both numerical and categorical variables. 5) Non Parametric Method Decision tree is considered to be a non-parametric method. This means that decision trees have no assumptions about the space distribution and the classifier structure. Disadvantages1) Over Fitting Over fitting is one of the most practical difficulty for decision tree models. This problem gets solved by setting constraints on model parameters and pruning (discussed in detailed below). 2) Not Fit for Continuous Variables While working with continuous numerical variables, decision tree looses information when it categorizes variables in different categories.","categories":[{"name":"ML","slug":"ML","permalink":"https://jetrobert.github.io/categories/ML/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Tree","slug":"Tree","permalink":"https://jetrobert.github.io/tags/Tree/"},{"name":"ML","slug":"ML","permalink":"https://jetrobert.github.io/tags/ML/"}],"author":"Stephen Cheng"}]}
